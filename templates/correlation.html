               In statistics, the correlation coefficient r measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables
                The value of r is always between +1 and –1. To interpret its value, see which of the following values your correlation r is closest to:
            <ul>
                <li> Exactly –1. A perfect downhill (negative) linear relationship   </li></a>
                <li>  –0.70. A strong downhill (negative) linear relationship  </li></a>
                <li>  –0.50. A moderate downhill (negative) relationship  </li></a>
                <li> –0.30. A weak downhill (negative) linear relationship   </li></a>
                <li>  0. No linear relationship  </li></a>
                <li> +0.30. A weak uphill (positive) linear relationship  </li></a>
                <li>  +0.50. A moderate uphill (positive) relationship   </li></a>
                <li>  +0.70. A strong uphill (positive) linear relationship   </li></a>
                <li>  Exactly +1. A perfect uphill (positive) linear relationship   </li></a>
